Modern infrastructure technologies like serverless computing and real-time databases offer a huge potential for new and improved online user experiences.

In this session, we’ll go through a practical use case to find out how we can harness their power in the context of WordPress.

We’ll build a Gutenberg block that shows status updates, to be incorporated into a status page. We’ll use serverless computing to allow adding status updates via a Slack command, and we’ll use a real-time database so that all visitors receive these updates in real-time without any impact on our WordPress server.
